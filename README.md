    * imblearn
    * joblib

## Install requirements
To install the project requirements, it is advisable to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies and avoid errors with your Python system installation.  
To create a virtual environment, you can use [this guide](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) directly from the official documentation of Python.  
Once the virtual environment has been set up, to install the required project packages one has to run the following instruction from the terminal:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
